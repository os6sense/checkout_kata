notonthehighstreet.com is an online marketplace, here is a sample of
some of the products available on our site:

----------------------------------------------------------
001 | Travel Card Holder | £9.25
002 | Personalised cufflinks | £45.00
003 | Kids T-shirt | £19.95

Our marketing team want to offer promotions as an incentive for
our customers to purchase these items.

If you spend over £60, then you get 10% off your purchase
If you buy 2 or more travel card holders then the price drops to
£8.50.

Our check-out can scan items in any order, and because our
promotions will change, it needs to be flexible regarding our
promotional rules.

The interface to our checkout looks like this (shown in Ruby):
 co = Checkout.new(promotional_rules)
 co.scan(item)
 co.scan(item)
 price = co.total

Implement a checkout system that fulfills these requirements.
